This plugin is meant to simplify a task I've found too common in my workflow:
switching between a single-line statement and a multi-line one.

The idea is to have a single key binding for transforming a line like this:

    <div id="foo">bar</div>

Into this:

    <div id="foo">
      bar
    </div>

And the other way around.

For more examples, corner cases, a few items that are still not working, take
a look at the
